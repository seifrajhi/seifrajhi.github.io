## kubectx

[Kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) is a command-line tool that allows users to switch between Kubernetes contexts (clusters) and namespaces more quickly and easily than using kubectl commands alone.

In Kubernetes, a context is a combination of a cluster, a user, and a namespace. You can have multiple contexts set up on your machine, each representing a different Kubernetes cluster, user, and namespace. Switching between contexts is necessary when working with multiple clusters or namespaces, and it can become tedious to type out the full kubectl command every time you need to switch.

Kubectx simplifies this process by providing a simple and intuitive command-line interface for switching between contexts. With Kubectx, you can use a single command to list all available contexts, switch to a different context, or even create a new context.

### Key Features of Kubectx

- **Fast switching between contexts**: Use the `kubectx` command followed by the context name to switch between contexts quickly.
- **Auto-completion**: Kubectx comes with built-in auto-completion for context names, making it easier to switch between contexts.
- **Context listing**: Use the `kubectx` command without any arguments to list all available contexts.

## kubens

[Kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) is a companion tool to kubectx that allows users to switch between Kubernetes namespaces quickly and easily.

In Kubernetes, namespaces provide a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users. Switching between namespaces can be cumbersome with the default kubectl commands, but kubens simplifies this process.

With Kubens, you can quickly switch between namespaces within a Kubernetes context and configure the active namespace for use with kubectl.

This can be especially useful when working with multiple namespaces within a single cluster, as it allows you to easily switch between them without having to type out the full kubectl command every time.

**Key Features of Kubens**

- **Fast switching between namespaces**: Use the `kubens` command followed by the namespace name to switch between namespaces quickly.
- **Auto-completion**: Kubens comes with built-in auto-completion for namespace names, making it easier to switch between namespaces.
- **Namespace listing**: Use the `kubens` command without any arguments to list all available namespaces.

## Stern


[Stern](https://github.com/stern/stern) is a tool for tailing and filtering logs from multiple Kubernetes pods simultaneously. It allows you to view logs from multiple containers and pods in a single stream, making it easier to debug and troubleshoot issues in Kubernetes applications.

**Key Features of Stern**

- **Multi-pod log tailing**: Tail logs from multiple pods and containers in real-time.
- **Filtering**: Apply filters to narrow down the logs you need to see.
- **Color-coded output**: Differentiate logs from various pods and containers with color-coded output.

## kubectl-who-can

[kubectl-who-can](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can) is a command-line tool designed to help you identify which users or service accounts have permissions to perform specific actions on Kubernetes resources. This tool is particularly useful for auditing and security purposes, as it allows you to quickly determine who can create, update, or delete resources within your cluster.

**Key Features of kubectl-who-can**

- **Permission Checks**: Determine which users or service accounts can perform specific actions on Kubernetes objects.
- **Resource-Specific Queries**: Check permissions for particular resources, such as pods, deployments, or services.
- **Action-Specific Queries**: Identify who can perform actions like `create`, `update`, or `delete` on specified resources.

## K9S

[K9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) is a terminal-based UI tool that provides a more user-friendly interface for managing Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to view and interact with Kubernetes resources (like pods, services, and deployments) more intuitively. You can use K9s to monitor the health of your applications, view logs, and perform actions like scaling or deleting resources.

**Key Features of K9s**

- **Intuitive Interface**: Navigate and manage Kubernetes resources with a user-friendly terminal UI.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the health and status of your applications in real-time.
