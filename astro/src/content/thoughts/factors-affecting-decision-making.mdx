There are no right decisions or choices.

Sometimes people call their decisions "right" when they like results. Yet, even in that case, the entire impact of the decision may not be realized. So, it happens that "good" decisions turn out into the "bad" ones after some time or even "bad" decisions work out well.

In this thought, we are going to review some factors that affect our process of decision making. Keep them in mind as they can change your mind and define what you choose.

## Factors

- [Emotions](#emotions)
- [Ramifications Go First](#ramifications-go-first)
- [Long-Term Outcomes](#long-term-outcomes)

<h3 id="emotions">Emotions</h3>

Our emotions tend to screw our decisions. We don't see a full picture when we are under strong feelings. Our perception is biased. It becomes easy to miss important details and rank things in the wrong way.

Emotions push us to make decisions quickly without profoundly considering the situation and conditions. Simply saying, the brain doesn't take part in making a decision, and emotion or idea drives us.

How do emotions impact decision making? They make us take hasty unconsidered decisions.

A proven way to avoid the impact of emotions is to postpone making decisions. Emotions want us to make decisions right now. Go in the opposite direction!

<h3 id="ramifications-go-first">Ramifications Go First</h3>

Benefits are another factor that may impact our decisions. They may be so sweet and desired that we forget to consider other sides of our choice. One of such sides is ramifications. Ramifications may hide from us. We don't want to suck the enjoyment out of benefits.

In any case, adverse outcomes are something we may need to deal with after we made the decision. That's why it's essential to start considering decisions from its negative consequences. Once we are ready to deal with ramifications, we may think about this decision further.

<h3 id="long-term-outcomes">Long-Term Outcomes</h3>

Usually, we review decisions in the short-term perspectives. But what this decision brings us in a few months, a year or five years? It's useful to understand possible long-term results. It helps to know how it moves us closer to our ideal state of life or business.

It may be reasonable to make decisions that look tough in short terms but that move us toward our goals. Similarly, pretty short-term decisions may turn into the complete wast of time if you look at them globally.

<Quote>Long-Term Outcomes is another way to look at your decisions. Make decisions that move you closer to your dreams.</Quote>
