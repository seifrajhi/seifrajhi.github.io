Don't search for disadvantages, because you will definitely find something! It's just easier to see the disadvantages. Look around: everything has disadvantages. At the same time, everything has advantages.

It is a poor approach to start with disadvantages. Instead, try to inspect the advantages.

I heard one inspiring story about this. Someone was walking along the street and saw a dead dog. Other walkers expressed revulsion.

- What a terrible picture!
- You are right, but notice how white its teeth are..

So did you notice the white teeth or the dog's body?
