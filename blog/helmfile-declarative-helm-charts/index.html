Helmfile will then take care of the rest, ensuring that your deployments are always up-to-date and consistent.\n\nIn this blog post, we will show you how to set up your first Helmfile. We will also discuss the benefits of using Helmfile and how it can help you simplify Kubernetes deployments.\n\n![helm](./helm.png)\n\n## 🐳 A Hands-On Introduction to Helmfile\n\nHelmfile is a declarative spec for deploying Helm charts. It lets you:\n\n- 📁 Keep a directory of chart value files and maintain changes in version control.\n- 🔄 Apply CI/CD to configuration changes.\n- 🌐 Environmental chart promotion.\n- 🔄 Periodically sync to avoid skew in environments.\n\nTo avoid upgrades for each iteration of Helm, the Helmfile executable delegates to Helm — as a result, Helm must be installed. All information is saved in the `helmfile.yaml` file. In case we need custom YAMLs, we'll use [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/).\n\nIf you want to follow my steps, you would need to install and configure:\n\n- 🐳 [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)\n- ☸️ Kubernetes cluster\n- 🖥️ Kubernetes command line tool — [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)\n- ⛵ [Helm (v3)](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\n- 📝 [Helmfile](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile)\n\n\n\n## ☸️🔧 Using Helmfile for Chart Deployment\n\nTo deploy a new chart with Helmfile, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Run `helmfile deps` and `helmfile diff`** to ensure your existing charts are updated. If not, run `helmfile apply`.\n2. **Configure the release in `helmfile.yaml`** by specifying:\n    - `name`: Deployment name.\n    - `namespace`: Kubernetes namespace for deployment.\n    - `chart`: Chart release.\n    - `values`: Path to the values file you've created.\n\n3. **Create a directory with the name of the chart**:\n\n     ```shell\n     mkdir {{ chart_name }}\n     ```\n\n4. **Copy the chart values into that directory**:\n\n     ```shell\n     helm inspect values {{ package_name }} > {{ chart_name }}/values.yaml\n     ```\n\n5. **Edit the `values.yaml` file** based on the chart documentation. Take care with image version specifications; comment out any lines specifying Docker image versions in the name, as upgrading the chart version without the image tag can disrupt the service.\n6. **Update the lock file** by running `helmfile deps`.\n7. **Check the changes** with `helmfile diff`.\n8. **Apply the changes** using `helmfile apply`.\n\n### ⬇️ Ensuring Up-to-Date Charts\n\nKeeping your charts updated using Helmfile is straightforward without the use of environments. Simply follow these steps:\n\n1. **Run `helmfile deps`** to update dependencies.\n2. **Use `helmfile diff`** to check for differences.\n3. **Apply changes** with `helmfile apply`.\n\nHowever, complexity arises when employing environments to enhance code reusability and minimize repetition. In such scenarios, careful planning and strategy are required to effectively manage chart updates.\n\n1. **Run `helmfile --environment=staging diff`** to review the changes to be introduced.\n2. To be able to see the differences of long diff files, you can filter it with `egrep`:\n\n     ```shell\n     helmfile diff | egrep -A20 -B20 \"^.{5}(\\-|\\+)\"\n     ```\n\n     This will show you all the changed lines with the 20 previous and next ones.\n\n3. Once you agree on them, **run `helmfile --environment=staging apply`** to apply them.\n4. **Check that all the Helm deployments** are well deployed with `helm list -A | grep -v deployed`.\n5. **Wait 20 minutes** to see if the monitoring system or your fellow partners start yelling at you.\n6. If something breaks up, try to fix it up. If you see it's going to delay you to the point that you're not going to be able to finish the upgrade in your working day, it's better to revert back to the working version of that chart and move on with the next steps.\n\n### ⚙️ Uninstalling Charts\n\nWhen it comes to removing charts with Helmfile, please note that charts won't be automatically removed by simply excluding them from your `helmfile.yaml`. To uninstall them, consider these options:\n\n- Set `installed: false` in the release candidate and then run `helmfile apply`.\n- Alternatively, delete the release definition from your `helmfile.yaml` and use regular Helm commands to remove it.\n\nChoosing the right approach depends on your specific needs and workflows.\n\n### 📂 Multi-environment Project Structure\n\nHelmfile can handle environments with many different project structures, such as the following:\n\n```shell\n├── README.md\n├── helmfile.yaml\n├── vars\n│   ├── production_secrets.yaml\n│   ├── production_values.yaml\n│   ├── default_secrets.yaml\n│   └── default_values.yaml\n├── charts\n│   ├── local_defined_chart_1\n│   └── local_defined_chart_2\n├── templates\n│   ├── environments.yaml\n│   └── templates.yaml\n├── base\n│   ├── README.md\n│   ├── helmfile.yaml\n│   ├── helmfile.lock\n│   ├── repos.yaml\n│   ├── chart_1\n│   │   ├── secrets.yaml\n│   │   ├── values.yaml\n│   │   ├── production_secrets.yaml\n│   │   ├── production_values.yaml\n│   │   ├── default_secrets.yaml\n│   │   └── default_values.yaml\n│   └── chart_2\n│       ├── secrets.yaml\n│       ├── values.yaml\n│       ├── production_secrets.yaml\n│       ├── production_values.yaml\n│       ├── default_secrets.yaml\n│       └── default_values.yaml\n└── service_1\n     ├── README.md\n     ├── helmfile.yaml\n     ├── helmfile.lock\n     ├── repos.yaml\n     ├── chart_1\n     │   ├── secrets.yaml\n     │   ├── values.yaml\n     │   ├── production_secrets.yaml\n     │   ├── production_values.yaml\n     │   ├── default_secrets.yaml\n     │   └── default_values.yaml\n     └── chart_2\n          ├── secrets.yaml\n          ├── values.yaml\n          ├── production_secrets.yaml\n          ├── production_values.yaml\n          ├── default_secrets.yaml\n          └── default_values.yaml\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n- There is a general `README.md` that introduces the repository.\n- Optionally, there could be a `helmfile.yaml` file at the root with a [glob pattern](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile#glob-patterns) so that it's easy to run commands on all children helmfiles.\n\n     ```yaml\n     helmfiles:\n        - ./*/helmfile.yaml\n     ```\n\n- There is a `vars` directory to store the variables and secrets shared by the charts that belong to different services.\n- There is a `templates` directory to store the Helmfile code to reuse [through template](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/devops/helmfile/#using-release-templates)s and [layering](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/devops/helmfile/#layering-the-state).\n- The project structure is defined by the services hosted in the Kubernetes cluster. Each service contains:\n  - A `README.md` to document the service implementation.\n  - A `helmfile.yaml` file to configure the service charts.\n  - A `helmfile.lock` to lock the versions of the service charts.\n  - A `repos.yaml` to define the repositories to fetch the charts from.\n  - One or more chart directories that contain the environment-specific and shared chart values and secrets.\n- There is a base service that manages all the charts required to keep the cluster running, such as the ingress, CSI, CNI, or the cluster-autoscaler.\n\n\n## ⚑ Using Helmfile Environments\n\nTo customize the contents of a `helmfile.yaml` or `values.yaml` file per environment, add them under the `environments` key in the `helmfile.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nenvironments:\n    default:\n    production:\n```\n\nThe environment name defaults to `default`, that is, `helmfile sync` implies the default environment. So it's a good idea to use `staging` as default to be more robust against human errors. If you want to specify a non-default environment, provide a `--environment NAME` flag to Helmfile like `helmfile --environment production sync`.\n\nIn the environments definition, we'll load the values and secrets from the `vars` directory with the next snippet:\n\n```yaml\nenvironments:\n    default:\n        secrets:\n            - ../vars/default_secrets.yaml\n        values:\n            - ../vars/default_values.yaml\n    production:\n        secrets:\n            - ../vars/production_secrets.yaml\n        values:\n            - ../vars/production_values.yaml\n```\n\nAs this snippet is going to be repeated in every `helmfile.yaml`, we'll use a [state layering](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/devops/helmfile/#layering-the-state) for it.\n\nTo install a release only in one environment, use:\n\n```yaml\nenvironments:\n    default:\n    production:\n\n---\n\nreleases:\n- name: newrelic-agent\n    installed: {{ eq .Environment.Name \"production\" | toYaml }}\n    # snip\n```\n\n## ⚑ Using Environment-Specific Variables\n\nEnvironment Values allow you to inject a set of values specific to the selected environment into `values.yaml` templates or `helmfile.yaml` files. Use it to inject common values from the environment to multiple values files, making your configuration DRY.\n\nSuppose you have three files: `helmfile.yaml`, `production.yaml`, and `values.yaml.gotmpl`.\n\n**`helmfile.yaml`:**\n\n```yaml\nenvironments:\n    production:\n        values:\n            - production.yaml\n\n---\n\nreleases:\n- name: myapp\n    values:\n        - values.yaml.gotmpl\n```\n\n**`production.yaml`:**\n\n```yaml\ndomain: prod.example.com\n```\n\n**`values.yaml.gotmpl`:**\n\n```yaml\ndomain: {{ .Values | get \"domain\" \"dev.example.com\" }}\n```\n\n## ⚑ Loading Chart Configurations and Secrets\n\nTo load secrets and values for each chart definition in the `helmfile.yaml`, follow these steps:\n\nFor instance, using the following snippet:\n\n```yaml\n- name: chart_1\n    values:\n        - ./chart_1/values.yaml\n        - ./chart_1/{{ Environment.Name }}_values.yaml\n    secrets:\n        - ./chart_1/secrets.yaml\n        - ./chart_1/{{ Environment.Name }}_secrets.yaml\n```\n\nThis snippet demonstrates how to properly load configurations and secrets for your chart definitions. By including this information, you ensure that your charts are set up effectively and securely based on your specific environment's requirements.\n\nThis assumes that the environment variable is set, as it's going to be shared by all the `helmfile.yaml` files. You can add it to the `vars` files:\n\n**`vars/production_values.yaml`:**\n\n```yaml\nenvironment: production\n```\n\n**`vars/default_values.yaml`:**\n\n```yaml\nenvironment: staging\n```\n\nInstead of `.Environment.Name`, in theory, you could have used `.Vars | get \"environment\"`, which could have prevented the variables and secrets of the default environment from needing to be called `default_values.yaml` and `default_secrets.yaml`, which is misleading. But you can't use `.Values` in the `helmfile.yaml` as it's not loaded when the file is parsed, and you get an error. A solution would be to layer the Helmfile state files.\n\n## ⚑ Using Release Templates\n\nFor each chart in a `helmfile.yaml`, we're going to repeat the values and secrets sections. To avoid it, we can use release templates:\n\n```yaml\ntemplates:\n    default: &default\n        # This prevents Helmfile from exiting when it encounters a missing file\n        # Valid values are \"Error\", \"Warn\", \"Info\", \"Debug\". The default is \"Error\"\n        # Use \"Debug\" to make missing files errors invisible at the default log level (--log-level=INFO)\n        missingFileHandler: Warn\n        values:\n        - {{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}}/values.yaml\n        - {{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}}/{{`{{ .Values | get \"environment\" }}`}}.yaml\n        secrets:\n        - config/{{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}}/secrets.yaml\n        - config/{{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}}/{{`{{ .Values | get \"environment\" }}`}}-secrets.yaml\n```\n\n```yaml\nreleases:\n- name: chart_1\n    chart: stable/chart_1\n    <<: *default\n- name: chart_2\n    chart: stable/chart_2\n    <<: *default\n```\n\nIf you're not familiar with YAML anchors, `&default` names the block, then `*default` references it. The `<<:` syntax says to \"extend\" (merge) that reference into the current tree.\n\nThe `missingFileHandler: Warn` field is necessary if you don't need all the values and secret files but want to use the same definition for all charts.\n\n`{{` `{{ .Release.Name }}` `}}` is surrounded by `{{` and `}}` so as not to be executed at the loading time of `helmfile.yaml`. We need to defer it until each release is actually processed by the Helmfile command, such as `diff` or `apply`.\n\n## 🏭 Layering the State\n\nYou may occasionally end up with many Helmfiles that share common parts like which repositories to use and which release to be bundled by default.\n\nUse Layering to extract the common parts into dedicated library Helmfiles so that each Helmfile becomes DRY.\n\nLet's assume that your code looks like:\n\n**`helmfile.yaml`:**\n\n```yaml\nbases:\n- environments.yaml\nreleases:\n- name: metricbeat\n    chart: stable/metricbeat\n- name: myapp\n    chart: mychart\n```\n\nFinally, the resulting YAML documents are merged in the order of occurrence, so that your `helmfile.yaml` becomes:\n\n```yaml\nenvironments:\n    development:\n    production:\nreleases:\n- name: metricbeat\n    chart: stable/metricbeat\n- name: myapp\n    chart: mychart\n```\n\nUsing this concept, we can reuse the environments section as:\n\n**`vars/environments.yaml`:**\n\n```yaml\nenvironments:\n    default:\n        secrets:\n            - ../vars/staging-secrets.yaml\n        values:\n            - ../vars/staging-values.yaml\n    production:\n        secrets:\n            - ../vars/production-secrets.yaml\n        values:\n            - ../vars/production-values.yaml\n```\n\nAnd the default release templates as:\n\n**`templates/templates.yaml`:**\n\n```yaml\ntemplates:\n    default: &default\n    values:\n    - {{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}}/values.yaml\n    - {{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}}/{{`{{ .Values | get \"environment\" }}`}}.yaml\n    secrets:\n    - config/{{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}}/secrets.yaml\n    - config/{{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}}/{{`{{ .Values | get \"environment\" }}`}}-secrets.yaml\n```\n\nSo the service's `helmfile.yaml` turns out to be:\n\n```yaml\nbases:\n- ../templates/environments.yaml\n- ../templates/templates.yaml\nreleases:\n- name: chart_1\n    chart: stable/chart_1\n    <<: *default\n- name: chart_2\n    chart: stable/chart_2\n    <<: *default\n```\n\nMuch shorter and simpler.\n\n## Keep Learning 👩‍💻👨‍💻\n\nIf you liked Helmfile, take some time to go through its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile), as you will better understand [all the advanced features](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/tree/main/examples) and options to customize releases and Helm behavior, as well as how to structure your Helmfile repository.\n\nRemember that the example presented in this article is just one way of organizing Helmfiles. You can give it a try and organize them as it better suits your needs: placing all releases and configuration in just one file, one file per release, etc. If you want to know more about how to organize your Helmfiles, you can give a look at the [Helmfile best practices guide](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/blob/main/docs/writing-helmfile.md).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHelmfile offers a streamlined and declarative approach to deploying Helm charts within Kubernetes environments.

<p>Helmfile is a tool that can help simplify Kubernetes deployments by automating the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helmfile</a> is a declarative tool that allows you to define the desired state of your Kubernetes deployments in a YAML file. Helmfile will then take care of the rest, ensuring that your deployments are always up-to-date and consistent.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will show you how to set up your first Helmfile. We will also discuss the benefits of using Helmfile and how it can help you simplify Kubernetes deployments.</p>

<p>Helmfile is a declarative spec for deploying Helm charts. It lets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>📁 Keep a directory of chart value files and maintain changes in version control.</li>
<li>🔄 Apply CI/CD to configuration changes.</li>
<li>🌐 Environmental chart promotion.</li>
<li>🔄 Periodically sync to avoid skew in environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid upgrades for each iteration of Helm, the Helmfile executable delegates to Helm — as a result, Helm must be installed. All information is saved in the <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code> file. In case we need custom YAMLs, we'll use <a href="https://kustomize.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kustomize</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to follow my steps, you would need to install and configure:</p>
<ul>
<li>🐳 <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a></li>
<li>☸️ Kubernetes cluster</li>
<li>🖥️ Kubernetes command line tool — <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kubectl</a></li>

<p>To deploy a new chart with Helmfile, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Run <code class="language-text">helmfile deps</code> and <code class="language-text">helmfile diff</code></strong> to ensure your existing charts are updated. If not, run <code class="language-text">helmfile apply</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configure the release in <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code></strong> by specifying:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="language-text">name</code>: Deployment name.</li>
<li><code class="language-text">namespace</code>: Kubernetes namespace for deployment.</li>
<li><code class="language-text">chart</code>: Chart release.</li>
<li><code class="language-text">values</code>: Path to the values file you've created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a directory with the name of the chart</strong>:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">mkdir</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> chart_name <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy the chart values into that directory</strong>:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">helm inspect values <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> package_name <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> chart_name <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>/values.yaml</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Edit the <code class="language-text">values.yaml</code> file</strong> based on the chart documentation. Take care with image version specifications; comment out any lines specifying Docker image versions in the name, as upgrading the chart version without the image tag can disrupt the service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Update the lock file</strong> by running <code class="language-text">helmfile deps</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check the changes</strong> with <code class="language-text">helmfile diff</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply the changes</strong> using <code class="language-text">helmfile apply</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Keeping your charts updated using Helmfile is straightforward without the use of environments. Simply follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Run <code class="language-text">helmfile deps</code></strong> to update dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Use <code class="language-text">helmfile diff</code></strong> to check for differences.</li>
<li><strong>Apply changes</strong> with <code class="language-text">helmfile apply</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, complexity arises when employing environments to enhance code reusability and minimize repetition. In such scenarios, careful planning and strategy are required to effectively manage chart updates.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Run <code class="language-text">helmfile --environment=staging diff</code></strong> to review the changes to be introduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be able to see the differences of long diff files, you can filter it with <code class="language-text">egrep</code>:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">helmfile <span class="token function">diff</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">egrep</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-A20</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-B20</span> <span class="token string">"^.{5}(\-|\+)"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will show you all the changed lines with the 20 previous and next ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you agree on them, <strong>run <code class="language-text">helmfile --environment=staging apply</code></strong> to apply them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check that all the Helm deployments</strong> are well deployed with <code class="language-text">helm list -A | grep -v deployed</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wait 20 minutes</strong> to see if the monitoring system or your fellow partners start yelling at you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If something breaks up, try to fix it up. If you see it's going to delay you to the point that you're not going to be able to finish the upgrade in your working day, it's better to revert back to the working version of that chart and move on with the next steps.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>When it comes to removing charts with Helmfile, please note that charts won't be automatically removed by simply excluding them from your <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code>. To uninstall them, consider these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set <code class="language-text">installed: false</code> in the release candidate and then run <code class="language-text">helmfile apply</code>.</li>
<li>Alternatively, delete the release definition from your <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code> and use regular Helm commands to remove it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing the right approach depends on your specific needs and workflows.</p>

<p>To customize the contents of a <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code> or <code class="language-text">values.yaml</code> file per environment, add them under the <code class="language-text">environments</code> key in the <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code>:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">environments</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
    <span class="token key atrule">default</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
    production<span class="token punctuation">:</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The environment name defaults to <code class="language-text">default</code>, that is, <code class="language-text">helmfile sync</code> implies the default environment. So it's a good idea to use <code class="language-text">staging</code> as default to be more robust against human errors. If you want to specify a non-default environment, provide a <code class="language-text">--environment NAME</code> flag to Helmfile like <code class="language-text">helmfile --environment production sync</code>.</p>
<p>In the environments definition, we'll load the values and secrets from the <code class="language-text">vars</code> directory with the next snippet:</p>

<p>Environment Values allow you to inject a set of values specific to the selected environment into <code class="language-text">values.yaml</code> templates or <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code> files. Use it to inject common values from the environment to multiple values files, making your configuration DRY.</p>
<p>Suppose you have three files: <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code>, <code class="language-text">production.yaml</code>, and <code class="language-text">values.yaml.gotmpl</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code>:</strong></p>

<p>To load secrets and values for each chart definition in the <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code>, follow these steps:</p>
<p>For instance, using the following snippet:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> chart_1
    <span class="token key atrule">values</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
        <span class="token punctuation">-</span> ./chart_1/values.yaml
        <span class="token punctuation">-</span> ./chart_1/<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> Environment.Name <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>_values.yaml
    <span class="token key atrule">secrets</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
        <span class="token punctuation">-</span> ./chart_1/secrets.yaml
        <span class="token punctuation">-</span> ./chart_1/<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> Environment.Name <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>_secrets.yaml</code></pre></div>
<p>This snippet demonstrates how to properly load configurations and secrets for your chart definitions. By including this information, you ensure that your charts are set up effectively and securely based on your specific environment's requirements.</p>
<p>This assumes that the environment variable is set, as it's going to be shared by all the <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code> files. You can add it to the <code class="language-text">vars</code> files:</p>
<p><strong><code class="language-text">vars/production_values.yaml</code>:</strong></p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">environment</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> production</code></pre></div>
<p><strong><code class="language-text">vars/default_values.yaml</code>:</strong></p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">environment</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> staging</code></pre></div>
<p>Instead of <code class="language-text">.Environment.Name</code>, in theory, you could have used <code class="language-text">.Vars | get "environment"</code>, which could have prevented the variables and secrets of the default environment from needing to be called <code class="language-text">default_values.yaml</code> and <code class="language-text">default_secrets.yaml</code>, which is misleading. But you can't use <code class="language-text">.Values</code> in the <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code> as it's not loaded when the file is parsed, and you get an error. A solution would be to layer the Helmfile state files.</p>

<p>For each chart in a <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code>, we're going to repeat the values and secrets sections. To avoid it, we can use release templates:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">templates</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
    <span class="token key atrule">default</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token important">&amp;default</span>
        <span class="token comment"># This prevents Helmfile from exiting when it encounters a missing file</span>
        <span class="token comment"># Valid values are "Error", "Warn", "Info", "Debug". The default is "Error"</span>
        <span class="token comment"># Use "Debug" to make missing files errors invisible at the default log level (--log-level=INFO)</span>
        <span class="token key atrule">missingFileHandler</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> Warn
        <span class="token key atrule">values</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>

<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">releases</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
<span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> chart_1

    <span class="token key atrule">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token important">*default</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you're not familiar with YAML anchors, <code class="language-text">&amp;default</code> names the block, then <code class="language-text">*default</code> references it. The <code class="language-text">&lt;&lt;:</code> syntax says to "extend" (merge) that reference into the current tree.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-text">missingFileHandler: Warn</code> field is necessary if you don't need all the values and secret files but want to use the same definition for all charts.</p>
<p><code class="language-text">{{</code> <code class="language-text">{{ .Release.Name }}</code> <code class="language-text">}}</code> is surrounded by <code class="language-text">{{</code> and <code class="language-text">}}</code> so as not to be executed at the loading time of <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code>. We need to defer it until each release is actually processed by the Helmfile command, such as <code class="language-text">diff</code> or <code class="language-text">apply</code>.</p>

<p>You may occasionally end up with many Helmfiles that share common parts like which repositories to use and which release to be bundled by default.</p>
<p>Use Layering to extract the common parts into dedicated library Helmfiles so that each Helmfile becomes DRY.</p>
<p>Let's assume that your code looks like:</p>
<p><strong><code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code>:</strong></p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">bases</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
<span class="token punctuation">-</span> environments.yaml
<span class="token key atrule">releases</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
<span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> metricbeat
    <span class="token key atrule">chart</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> stable/metricbeat
<span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> myapp
    <span class="token key atrule">chart</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> mychart</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, the resulting YAML documents are merged in the order of occurrence, so that your <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code> becomes:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">environments</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
    <span class="token key atrule">development</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
    <span class="token key atrule">production</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
<span class="token key atrule">releases</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
<span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> metricbeat
    <span class="token key atrule">chart</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> stable/metricbeat
<span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> myapp
    <span class="token key atrule">chart</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> mychart</code></pre></div>
<p>Using this concept, we can reuse the environments section as:</p>
<p><strong><code class="language-text">vars/environments.yaml</code>:</strong></p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">environments</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
    <span class="token key atrule">default</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
        <span class="token key atrule">secrets</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
            <span class="token punctuation">-</span> ../vars/staging<span class="token punctuation">-</span>secrets.yaml
        <span class="token key atrule">values</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
            <span class="token punctuation">-</span> ../vars/staging<span class="token punctuation">-</span>values.yaml
    <span class="token key atrule">production</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
        <span class="token key atrule">secrets</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
            <span class="token punctuation">-</span> ../vars/production<span class="token punctuation">-</span>secrets.yaml
        <span class="token key atrule">values</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
            <span class="token punctuation">-</span> ../vars/production<span class="token punctuation">-</span>values.yaml</code></pre></div>
<p>And the default release templates as:</p>
<p><strong><code class="language-text">templates/templates.yaml</code>:</strong></p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">templates</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
    <span class="token key atrule">default</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token important">&amp;default</span>
    <span class="token key atrule">values</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>`<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> .Release.Name <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>`<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>/values.yaml
    <span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>`<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> .Release.Name <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>`<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>/<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>`<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> .Values <span class="token punctuation">|</span> get "environment" <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>`<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>.yaml
    <span class="token key atrule">secrets</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">-</span> config/<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>`<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> .Release.Name <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>`<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>/secrets.yaml
    <span class="token punctuation">-</span> config/<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>`<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> .Release.Name <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>`<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>/<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>`<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> .Values <span class="token punctuation">|</span> get "environment" <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>`<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">-</span>secrets.yaml</code></pre></div>
<p>So the service's <code class="language-text">helmfile.yaml</code> turns out to be:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">bases</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
<span class="token punctuation">-</span> ../templates/environments.yaml
<span class="token punctuation">-</span> ../templates/templates.yaml
<span class="token key atrule">releases</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
<span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> chart_1
    <span class="token key atrule">chart</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> stable/chart_1
    <span class="token key atrule">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token important">*default</span>
<span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> chart_2
    <span class="token key atrule">chart</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> stable/chart_2

<p>If you liked Helmfile, take some time to go through its <a href="https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repo</a>, as you will better understand <a href="https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/tree/main/examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all the advanced features</a> and options to customize releases and Helm behavior, as well as how to structure your Helmfile repository.</p>
<p>Remember that the example presented in this article is just one way of organizing Helmfiles. You can give it a try and organize them as it better suits your needs: placing all releases and configuration in just one file, one file per release, etc. If you want to know more about how to organize your Helmfiles, you can give a look at the <a href="https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/blob/main/docs/writing-helmfile.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helmfile best practices guide</a>.</p>
