Software engineers are huge automation enthusiasts, so it’s natural that AI-powered tools for Kubernetes operators are starting to pop up.\n\nMost of these tools are designed for terminal (CLI) usage. Kubernetes is the go-to platform for container orchestration, but its complexity can be daunting. AI-powered tools can help you master Kubernetes by automating tasks, improving reliability, and providing insights.\n\nOne of the most promising AI platforms for Kubernetes AIOps is OpenAI. OpenAI provides a suite of open-source tools that can be used to build AI-powered solutions for Kubernetes.\n\n\n![AI photo](./overview.png)\n\n## Overview\n\nKubernetes users inevitably encounter cluster issues that require debugging and fixing to keep their pods and services running smoothly. Whether you are new to Kubernetes or managing large and complex environments, debugging in-cluster processes can be challenging and time-consuming.\n\nCloud-native DevOps involves a lot of complexity in managing containers, microservices and autoscaling capabilities. Generative AI could help troubleshoot and perform some of the operational tasks associated with platforms like Kubernetes. This could involve using natural language prompts to spin up, roll back or get visibility into clusters.\n\nFor example, at [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2023](https://thenewstack.io/kubiya-launches-first-generative-ai-for-platform-engineering/), Kubiya debuted a generative AI workflow engine that's able to interpret such commands from within Slack. Extending natural language processing might aid platform teams in creating new workflows that abstract the complexity of working [with cloud-native platforms](https://cloudnativenow.com/features/2023-marks-the-rise-of-cloud-native-platforms/).\n\n## ✨ k8sgpt\n\n[K8sGPT](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt) is a relatively new open source project that uses AI models to explain Kubernetes error messages and provide cluster insights. It is already used by two organizations in production and has applied to become a CNCF sandbox project.\n\nK8sGPT Features:\n\n- Provides detailed and contextualized explanations of Kubernetes error messages.\n- Provides cluster insights.\n- Supports multiple installation options.\n- Supports different AI backends.\n\nK8sgpt is the most well-known and widely used project of its kind. Launched by [Alex Jones](https://x.com/AlexJonesax), it is marketed as a way to \"give Kubernetes superpowers to everyone.\"\n\nK8sgpt is a CLI tool with a primary command, `k8sgpt analyze`, which is designed to reveal problems in your Kubernetes cluster. It does this by using \"analyzers,\" which define the logic for each Kubernetes object and the possible problems it may be encountering. For example, an analyzer for Kubernetes Services will check whether a particular Service exists and has endpoints, and whether its endpoints are ready.\n\nIdentifying such an issue is not a big deal in and of itself, but the magic happens when you ask k8sgpt to explain what you can do about it. To do this, you run the command `k8sgpt analyze --explain`. This will ask the AI for instructions for your specific case and display them for you.\n\nThe instructions will include the actions to take to troubleshoot the problem, including specific kubectl commands that you can execute by simply copying and pasting them. This is made possible by the fact that the names of your Kubernetes resources are already in place.\n\n![AI photo](./k8sgpt-analyse.gif)\n\n### Installation\n\nThere are several installation options available depending on your preferences and Operating system. You can find the different options in [the installation section of the documentation](https://docs.k8sgpt.ai/getting-started/installation/).\nThe prerequisite for installing K8sGPT as mentioned below is to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed either on your Mac or WSL on your Windows machine.\n\nNext, you can run the following commands:\n\n```Shell\nbrew tap k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt\nbrew install k8sgpt\n```\n\nTo view all the commands provided by K8sGPT, used the `--help` flag:\n\n```Shell\nk8sgpt --help\n```\n\nYou can see an overview of the different commands also [on the documentation](https://docs.k8sgpt.ai/reference).\n\nNext, we will have to authorise an AI backend. In this video, we will use OpenAI.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThe prerequisites to follow the next sections is to have an OpneAI account and a running Kubernetes cluster; any cluster, such as microk8s or minikube will be sufficient.\nOnce you have the OpneAI account, you want to go to the following site to generate a new [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\nAlternatively, you can run the following command and K8sGPT will open the same site in your default Browser:\n\n```Shell\nk8sgpt generate\n```\n\nThis key is needed for K8sGPT to interact with OpenAI. Authorise K8sGPT with the newly created API key/token:\n\n```Shell\nk8sgpt auth add openai\nEnter openai Key: openai added to the AI backend provider list\n```\n\nYou can list your backends with the following command:\n\n```Shell\nk8sgpt auth list\nDefault:\n> openai\nActive:\n> openai\nUnused:\n> localai\n> azureopenai\n> noopai\n```\n\nAgain, [our documentation](https://docs.k8sgpt.ai/reference/providers/backend/?ref=anaisurl.com) provides further information on the different AI backends available.\n\nNext, we will install a malicious Deployment into our Kubernetes cluster. The pod will go into CrashLoopBackOff. Here is the YAML:\n\n```Yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-deployment\n  labels:\n    app: nginx\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.14.2\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n        securityContext:\n          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true\n```\n\nNext, we will create a dedicated namespace for our example application and install the Deployment:\n\n```shell\nkubectl create ns demo\nnamespace/demo created\n```\n\nThen we apply the manifest:\n\n```Shell\nkubectl apply -f ./deployment.yaml -n demo\ndeployment.apps/nginx-deployment created\n```\n\nNow you will see the pods in our demo namespace throwing errors:\n\n![Errors in demo namespace](./errors.png)\n\nIf we look at the events for one of the pods, we will not become much smarter:\n\n```shell\nWarning  BackOff\t3s (x8 over 87s)  kubelet        \tBack-off restarting failed container\n```\n\nSo what we can do instead to access more details on why these pods are erroring, we can run a K8sGPT command:\n\n```shell\nk8sgpt analyse\n```\n\nThis will show us the problems that k8sGPT found inside our cluster:\n```shell\nAI Provider: openai\n```\nTo receive further information as well as recommendations on how to fix the issues, we can use the --explain flag:\n```shell \nk8sgpt analyse --explain\n0 demo/nginx-deployment-5f4c7db77b-hq74n(Deployment/nginx-deployment)\n- Error: back-off 1m20s restarting failed container=nginx pod=nginx-deployment-5f4c7db77b-hq74n_demo(7854b793-21b7-4f81-86e5-dbb4113f64f4)\n1 demo/nginx-deployment-5f4c7db77b-phbq8(Deployment/nginx-deployment)\n- Error: back-off 1m20s restarting failed container=nginx pod=nginx-deployment-5f4c7db77b-phbq8_demo(74038531-e362-45a6-a436-cf1a6ea46d8a)\n2 demo/nginx-deployment-5f4c7db77b-shkw6(Deployment/nginx-deployment)\n- Error: back-off 1m20s restarting failed container=nginx pod=nginx-deployment-5f4c7db77b-shkw6_demo(2603f332-3e1c-45da-8080-e34dd6d956ad)\n```\n\n## ✨ kubectl-ai project\n\n[This project](https://github.com/sozercan/kubectl-ai) is a kubectl plugin to generate and apply Kubernetes manifests using OpenAI GPT. To make it more interesting and understand in a visualized way, we will make use of Kubectl + OpenAI plugin.\n\n### Installation\n\n**Homebrew:**\n\nAdd to brew tap and install with:\n\n```shell\nbrew tap sozercan/kubectl-ai https://github.com/sozercan/kubectl-ai\nbrew install kubectl-ai\n```\n\n**Krew:**\nAdd to krew index and install with:\n\n```shell\nkubectl krew index add kubectl-ai https://github.com/sozercan/kubectl-ai\nkubectl krew install kubectl-ai/kubectl-ai\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\nkubectl-ai requires a valid Kubernetes configuration and one of the following:\n\n- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/overview)\n- [Azure OpenAI Service API key and endpoint](https://aka.ms/azure-openai)\n- [Local AI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI) (see [getting started](https://localai.io/basics/getting_started/index.html))\n\nFor OpenAI, Azure OpenAI or LocalAI, you can use the following environment variables:\n\n```shell\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI key>\nexport OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your OpenAI deployment/model name. defaults to \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0301\">\nexport OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your OpenAI endpoint, like \"https://my-aoi-endpoint.openai.azure.com\" or \"http://localhost:8080/v1\">\n```\n\nIf `OPENAI_ENDPOINT` variable is set, then it will use the endpoint. Otherwise, it will use OpenAI API.\n\nAzure OpenAI service does not allow certain characters, such as ., in the deployment name. Consequently, kubectl-ai will automatically replace `gpt-3`.`5-turbo` to `gpt-35-turbo` for Azure. However, if you use an Azure OpenAI deployment name completely different from the model name, you can set `AZURE_OPENAI_MAP` environment variable to map the model name to the **Azure OpenAI** deployment name. For example:\n\n```shell\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_MAP=\"gpt-3.5-turbo=my-deployment\"\n```\n\n### Demo\n\n**Nginx Pod:**\n\nRun the below command:\n\n```Shell\nkubectl ai \"create an nginx pod\"\nkubectl ai \"create an nginx pod\"\n✨ Attempting to apply the following manifest:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx\n    image: nginx\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 80\nUse the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ← \n?

Its goal is to help developers and DevOps engineers to easily manage and monitor their Kubernetes clusters.\n![KoPylot](./KoPylot.png)\n\n\n### KoPylot features\n\nAt the current version, KoPylot has four main features. These features can be translated into subcommands for the kopylot CLI. The subcommands are Audit, Chat, Ctl, and Diagnose. Let's dive into these commands now.\n![KoPylot-feat](./KoPylot-features.png)\n\n**🔍 Audit:**\n\nAudit resources, such as pods, deployments, and services. KoPylot will take a single resource and look for vulnerabilities based on its manifest file.\n\n![audit](./Audit.png)\n\n**💬 Chat:**\n\nAsk KoPylot in plain English to generate kubectl commands. You will be able to review the command before running it 😉.\n\n![chat](./chat.png)\n\n**🩺 Diagnose:**\n\nYou can use the diagnose tool to help you debug the different components of your application, such as pods, deployments, and services. The diagnose command will list for you possible fixes for the broken resource.\n\n![KoPylot](./diagnose.png)\n\n**☸️ Ctl:**\n\nA wrapper around kubectl. All the arguments passed to the ctl subcommand are interpreted by kubectl.\n\n![ctl](./ctl.png)\n\n### How does KoPylot work?\n\nAt the moment, KoPylot works by extracting information from the Kubernetes resource description *(kubectl describe …)* or manifest and feeding it into [OpenAI's Davinci model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview) together with a prompt. The prompt tells the model what to do with the Kubernetes resource.\n\nThe prompt is also responsible for guiding how the model should structure the output. For example, the prompt used for[the Audit command](https://github.com/avsthiago/kopylot/blob/main/kopylot/prompts.py#L15) asks the model to output the results as a two-column JSON containing the vulnerabilities and their Severities.\n\n\n### How good are the outputs?\n\nI tested KoPylot on a dummy cluster with some broken pods, some with vulnerabilities and others without. What I noticed is that the Davinci model can give good directions when diagnosing a broken pod. Sometimes the advice will be too short for one to understand, but by running the diagnose command 2–3 times, it is possible to pinpoint the issue.\n\n## ✨ Kopilot 🧑‍✈️: AI Kubernetes Expert\n\n[Kopilot](https://github.com/knight42/kopilot) is the only one out of these projects written in Go. It covers two functions, troubleshooting and auditing. So what do they do?\n\n### Installation guide\n\n**macOS:**\n\n```shell\nbrew install knight42/tap/kopilot\n```\n\nKrew:\n\n```shell\nkubectl krew install kopilot\n```\n\n### Usage guide\n\nCurrently, you need to set two ENVs to run Kopilot:\n\n- Set `KOPILOT_TOKEN` to specify your token.\n- Set KOPILOT_LANG to specify the language, defaults to English. Valid options are `Chinese`, `French`, `Spain`, etc.\n- `KOPILOT_TOKEN_TYPE` will be available soon to let you specify AI services other than ChatGPT. Please stay tuned.\n\n### Highlight\n\n- Diagnose any unhealthy workload in your cluster and tell you what might be the cause\n\n![Kopylot](./Kopilot.gif)\n\n- Audit Kubernetes resource and find the security misconfigurations\n\n![Audits](./Audits.gif)\n\nImagine you have a Pod that is stuck in Pending or CrashLoopBackOff. This is when the kopilot diagnose command will come in handy. It will reach AI for help and print you its answer with possible explanations as to why this has happened.\n\n![kopilot-diagnose](./kopilot-diagnose.png)\n\nNot sure if your Deployment is good enough? The kopilot audit command, using a similar approach, will check it against the well-known best practices and possible security misconfigurations.\n\nThis tool will use your OpenAI API token and the human language of your choice for the answers. The README also hints that there will be an option to use other AI services in the future.\n\nSadly, the project hasn't seen any commits since the beginning of April, raising obvious concerns.\n\n## ✨ Kubectl-GPT\n\n[Kubectl-GPT](https://github.com/devinjeon/kubectl-gpt) is a kubectl plugin to generate kubectl commands from natural language input by using GPT model.\n\nThis plugin introduces the `kubectl gpt` command, whose sole mission is to make your wishes - i.e. requests stated in human language - come true in your Kubernetes cluster. Here are examples of what you can expect from this plugin as outlined in its documentation:\n\n### Installation\n\n**Homebrew:**\n\n```shell\n# Install Homebrew: https://brew.sh/\nbrew tap devinjeon/kubectl-gpt https://github.com/devinjeon/kubectl-gpt\nbrew install kubectl-gpt\n```\n\n**Krew:**\n\n```shell\n# Install Krew: https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/\nkubectl krew index add devinjeon https://github.com/devinjeon/kubectl-gpt\nkubectl krew install devinjeon/gpt\n```\n\n### Usage mode\n\nRun the command line tool with your natural language input to generate a kubectl command.\n\n```shell\nkubectl gpt \"<WHAT-YOU-WANT-TO-DO>\"\n```\n\nCommands generated by the GPT model may not always be perfect, please verify them before execution.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\nBefore you start, make sure to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can get a key for using the OpenAI API [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n\nYou can add the following line to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:\n```shell\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nIt depends on the languages supported by the OpenAI GPT API.\n\n```shell\n# English\nkubectl gpt \"Print the creation time and pod name of all pods in all namespaces.\"\nkubectl gpt \"Print the memory limit and request of all pods\"\nkubectl gpt \"Increase the replica count of the coredns deployment to 2\"\nkubectl gpt \"Switch context to the kube-system namespace\"\n# Korean\nkubectl gpt \"현재 namespace에서 각 pod 별 생성시간 출력\"\nkubectl gpt \"coredns deployment의 replica를 2로 증가\"\n```\n\nThis project is developed by a solitary enthusiast and hasn't seen any updates since the end of May.\n\n## ✨ kube-copilot\n\n[Kubernetes Copilot](https://github.com/feiskyer/kube-copilot) powered by OpenAI.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Automate Kubernetes cluster operations using ChatGPT (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5).\n- Diagnose and analyze the potential issues for Kubernetes workloads.\n- Generate the Kubernetes manifests based on the provided prompt instructions.\n- Utilize native kubectl and trivy commands for Kubernetes cluster access and security vulnerability scanning.\n- Access the web and perform Google searches without leaving the terminal.\n\n\n**Install:**\n\n*Run in Kubernetes:*\n\n- Option 1: Web UI with Helm (recommended)\n\n```shell\n# Option 1: OpenAI\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"<replace-this>\"\nhelm install kube-copilot kube-copilot \\\n  --repo https://feisky.xyz/kube-copilot \\\n  --set openai.apiModel=gpt-4 \\\n  --set openai.apiKey=$OPENAI_API_KEY\n\n# Option 2: Azure OpenAI Service\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"<replace-this>\"\nexport OPENAI_API_BASE=\"<replace-this>\"\nhelm install kube-copilot kube-copilot \\\n  --repo https://feisky.xyz/kube-copilot \\\n  --set openai.apiModel=gpt-4 \\\n  --set openai.apiKey=$OPENAI_API_KEY \\\n  --set openai.apiBase=$OPENAI_API_BASE\n# Forwarding requests to the service\nkubectl port-forward service/kube-copilot 8080:80\necho \"Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use the copilot\"\n```\n\n*Option 2: CLI with kubectl*\n\n```shell\nkubectl run -it --rm copilot \\\n  --env=\"OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  --restart=Never \\\n  --image=ghcr.io/feiskyer/kube-copilot \\\n  --execute --verbose 'What Pods are using max memory in the cluster'\n```\n**Local Install:**\n\nInstall the copilot with pip command below:\n\n```Python\npip install kube-copilot\n```\n\n**Setup:**\n\n- Ensure [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) is installed on the local machine and the kubeconfig file is configured for Kubernetes cluster access.\n- Install [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) to assess container image security issues (for the audit command).\n- Set the [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to enable ChatGPT functionality.\n- For [Azure OpenAI service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart?tabs=command-line&pivots=rest-api#retrieve-key-and-endpoint), also set `OPENAI_API_TYPE=azure` and `OPENAI_API_BASE=https://<replace-this>.openai.azure.com/`.\n- Google search is disabled by default.

Flag critical alerts and prioritize them for your team to look at\n- **Alert Enrichment:** Automatically add context to alerts - like logs and microservice health info - to find root causes faster   \n- **Identify Cloud Problems** by asking HolmesGPT questions about unhealthy infrastructure\n- **Runbook Automation in Plain English:** Speed up your response to known issues by investigating according to runbooks you provide\n\n\n### See it in Action\n\n![AI Alert Analysis](./holmesgptdemo.gif)\n\n\n**Examples**\n\n- Kubernetes Troubleshooting\n\n```bash\nholmes ask \"what pods are unhealthy in my cluster and why?\"\n```\n\n- Prometheus Alert RCA (root cause analysis)\n\nInvestigate Prometheus alerts right from Slack with the official [Robusta integration](https://docs.robusta.dev/holmes_chart_dependency/configuration/ai-analysis.html).\n\n![342708962-e0c9ccde-299e-41d7-84e3-c201277a9ccb (1)](https://github.com/robusta-dev/holmesgpt/assets/494087/fd2451b0-b951-4798-af62-f69affac831e)\n\nOr run HolmesGPT from the cli:\n\n```bash\nkubectl port-forward alertmanager-robusta-kube-prometheus-st-alertmanager-0 9093:9093 &\nholmes investigate alertmanager --alertmanager-url http://localhost:9093\n```\n\nNote - if on Mac OS and using the Docker image, you will need to use `http://docker.for.mac.localhost:9093` instead of `http://localhost:9093`\n\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Connects to Existing Observability Data:** Find correlations you didn’t know about. No need to gather new data or add instrumentation.\n- **Compliance Friendly:** Can be run on-premise with your own LLM (or in the cloud with OpenAI/Azure/AWS)\n- **Transparent Results:** See a log of the AI’s actions and what data it gathered to understand how it reached conclusions\n- **Extensible Data Sources:** Connect the AI to custom data by providing your own tool definitions\n- **Runbook Automation:** Optionally provide runbooks in plain English and the AI will follow them automatically\n- **Integrates with Existing Workflows:** Connect Slack and Jira to get results inside your existing tools\n\n\n<h1 align=\"center\">🔰 Keep Learning !!

<p>Kubernetes users inevitably encounter cluster issues that require debugging and fixing to keep their pods and services running smoothly. Whether you are new to Kubernetes or managing large and complex environments, debugging in-cluster processes can be challenging and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Cloud-native DevOps involves a lot of complexity in managing containers, microservices and autoscaling capabilities. Generative AI could help troubleshoot and perform some of the operational tasks associated with platforms like Kubernetes. This could involve using natural language prompts to spin up, roll back or get visibility into clusters.</p>
<p>For example, at <a href="https://thenewstack.io/kubiya-launches-first-generative-ai-for-platform-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2023</a>, Kubiya debuted a generative AI workflow engine that's able to interpret such commands from within Slack. Extending natural language processing might aid platform teams in creating new workflows that abstract the complexity of working <a href="https://cloudnativenow.com/features/2023-marks-the-rise-of-cloud-native-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with cloud-native platforms</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K8sGPT</a> is a relatively new open source project that uses AI models to explain Kubernetes error messages and provide cluster insights. It is already used by two organizations in production and has applied to become a CNCF sandbox project.</p>
<p>K8sGPT Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides detailed and contextualized explanations of Kubernetes error messages.</li>
<li>Provides cluster insights.</li>
<li>Supports multiple installation options.</li>
<li>Supports different AI backends.</li>
</ul>
<p>K8sgpt is the most well-known and widely used project of its kind. Launched by <a href="https://x.com/AlexJonesax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Jones</a>, it is marketed as a way to "give Kubernetes superpowers to everyone."</p>
<p>K8sgpt is a CLI tool with a primary command, <code class="language-text">k8sgpt analyze</code>, which is designed to reveal problems in your Kubernetes cluster. It does this by using "analyzers," which define the logic for each Kubernetes object and the possible problems it may be encountering. For example, an analyzer for Kubernetes Services will check whether a particular Service exists and has endpoints, and whether its endpoints are ready.</p>
<p>Identifying such an issue is not a big deal in and of itself, but the magic happens when you ask k8sgpt to explain what you can do about it. To do this, you run the command <code class="language-text">k8sgpt analyze --explain</code>. This will ask the AI for instructions for your specific case and display them for you.</p>
<p>The instructions will include the actions to take to troubleshoot the problem, including specific kubectl commands that you can execute by simply copying and pasting them. This is made possible by the fact that the names of your Kubernetes resources are already in place.</p>

<p>There are several installation options available depending on your preferences and Operating system. You can find the different options in <a href="https://docs.k8sgpt.ai/getting-started/installation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the installation section of the documentation</a>.
The prerequisite for installing K8sGPT as mentioned below is to have <a href="https://brew.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a> installed either on your Mac or WSL on your Windows machine.</p>
<p>Next, you can run the following commands:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">brew tap k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt
brew <span class="token function">install</span> k8sgpt</code></pre></div>
<p>To view all the commands provided by K8sGPT, used the <code class="language-text">--help</code> flag:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">k8sgpt <span class="token parameter variable">--help</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see an overview of the different commands also <a href="https://docs.k8sgpt.ai/reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we will have to authorise an AI backend. In this video, we will use OpenAI.</p>

<p>The prerequisites to follow the next sections is to have an OpneAI account and a running Kubernetes cluster; any cluster, such as microk8s or minikube will be sufficient.
Once you have the OpneAI account, you want to go to the following site to generate a new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API key</a>.
Alternatively, you can run the following command and K8sGPT will open the same site in your default Browser:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">k8sgpt generate</code></pre></div>
<p>This key is needed for K8sGPT to interact with OpenAI. Authorise K8sGPT with the newly created API key/token:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">k8sgpt auth <span class="token function">add</span> openai
Enter openai Key: openai added to the AI backend provider list</code></pre></div>
<p>You can list your backends with the following command:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">k8sgpt auth list
Default:
<span class="token operator">></span> openai
Active:
<span class="token operator">></span> openai
Unused:
<span class="token operator">></span> localai
<span class="token operator">></span> azureopenai
<span class="token operator">></span> noopai</code></pre></div>
<p>Again, <a href="https://docs.k8sgpt.ai/reference/providers/backend/?ref=anaisurl.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our documentation</a> provides further information on the different AI backends available.</p>
<p>Next, we will install a malicious Deployment into our Kubernetes cluster. The pod will go into CrashLoopBackOff. Here is the YAML:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="yaml"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">apiVersion</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> apps/v1

          <span class="token key atrule">readOnlyRootFilesystem</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean important">true</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we will create a dedicated namespace for our example application and install the Deployment:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created</code></pre></div>
<p>Then we apply the manifest:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">kubectl apply <span class="token parameter variable">-f</span> ./deployment.yaml <span class="token parameter variable">-n</span> demo
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created</code></pre></div>

<p>If we look at the events for one of the pods, we will not become much smarter:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">Warning  BackOff	3s <span class="token punctuation">(</span>x8 over 87s<span class="token punctuation">)</span>  kubelet        	Back-off restarting failed container</code></pre></div>
<p>So what we can do instead to access more details on why these pods are erroring, we can run a K8sGPT command:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">k8sgpt analyse</code></pre></div>
<p>This will show us the problems that k8sGPT found inside our cluster:</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<p>kubectl-ai requires a valid Kubernetes configuration and one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://platform.openai.com/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI API key</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aka.ms/azure-openai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure OpenAI Service API key and endpoint</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local AI</a> (see <a href="https://localai.io/basics/getting_started/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting started</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>For OpenAI, Azure OpenAI or LocalAI, you can use the following environment variables:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">OPENAI_API_KEY</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span>your OpenAI key<span class="token operator">></span>
<span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span>your OpenAI deployment/model name. defaults to <span class="token string">"gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"</span><span class="token operator">></span>
<span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">OPENAI_ENDPOINT</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span>your OpenAI endpoint, like <span class="token string">"https://my-aoi-endpoint.openai.azure.com"</span> or <span class="token string">"http://localhost:8080/v1"</span><span class="token operator">></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If <code class="language-text">OPENAI_ENDPOINT</code> variable is set, then it will use the endpoint. Otherwise, it will use OpenAI API.</p>
<p>Azure OpenAI service does not allow certain characters, such as ., in the deployment name. Consequently, kubectl-ai will automatically replace <code class="language-text">gpt-3</code>.<code class="language-text">5-turbo</code> to <code class="language-text">gpt-35-turbo</code> for Azure. However, if you use an Azure OpenAI deployment name completely different from the model name, you can set <code class="language-text">AZURE_OPENAI_MAP</code> environment variable to map the model name to the <strong>Azure OpenAI</strong> deployment name. For example:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="shell"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">AZURE_OPENAI_MAP</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"gpt-3.5-turbo=my-deployment"</span></code></pre></div>

<p>At the moment, KoPylot works by extracting information from the Kubernetes resource description <em>(kubectl describe …)</em> or manifest and feeding it into <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI's Davinci model</a> together with a prompt. The prompt tells the model what to do with the Kubernetes resource.</p>
<p>The prompt is also responsible for guiding how the model should structure the output. For example, the prompt used for<a href="https://github.com/avsthiago/kopylot/blob/main/kopylot/prompts.py#L15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Audit command</a> asks the model to output the results as a two-column JSON containing the vulnerabilities and their Severities.</p>

<p>I tested KoPylot on a dummy cluster with some broken pods, some with vulnerabilities and others without. What I noticed is that the Davinci model can give good directions when diagnosing a broken pod. Sometimes the advice will be too short for one to understand, but by running the diagnose command 2–3 times, it is possible to pinpoint the issue.</p>

<p>Not sure if your Deployment is good enough? The kopilot audit command, using a similar approach, will check it against the well-known best practices and possible security misconfigurations.</p>
<p>This tool will use your OpenAI API token and the human language of your choice for the answers. The README also hints that there will be an option to use other AI services in the future.</p>
<p>Sadly, the project hasn't seen any commits since the beginning of April, raising obvious concerns.</p>
