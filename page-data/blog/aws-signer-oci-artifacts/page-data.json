It only supports host and path matching, and there is no standard configuration for advanced routing features, which can only be achieved through annotation, such as URL redirection using Nginx Ingress Controller, which requires configuration of <code class=\"language-text\">nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target</code> annotation, which is no longer adaptable to the needs of a programmable proxy.</p>\n<p>The situation where services in different namespaces must be bound to the same gateway often arises in practical situations where the ingress gateway cannot be shared across multiple namespaces.</p>\n<p>No delineation of responsibilities for creating and managing ingress gateways, resulting in developers having to not only configure gateway routes but also create and manage gateways themselves.</p>\n<p>To tackle these challenges, the Kubernetes SIG-NETWORK group initiated the development of the Gateway API in 2019. The Kubernetes Gateway API serves as a unified and adaptable solution that seamlessly integrates with native Kubernetes resources, addresses advanced use cases, adopts a role-centric approach, and emphasizes portability.</p>\n<p>The core concept is to move away from a one-size-fits-all model and capitalize on the benefits of more comprehensive frameworks. The Gateway API represents a significant advancement beyond traditional Ingress; it presents a more capable, extensible, and secure solution for managing traffic in Kubernetes environments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"-gateway-api-vs-ingress\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-gateway-api-vs-ingress\" aria-label=\" gateway api vs ingress permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg class=\"anchor-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a>🚀 Gateway API vs. Ingress</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes Gateway API is a specification overseen by the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SIG-NETWORK community</a>, aimed at modeling service networking within Kubernetes.

It started in 2022 to make the Gateway API better for how services communicate within a cluster.</p>\n<p>Originally, the Gateway API was mainly for managing traffic from outside to inside a cluster (like a front door). But as more people wanted to use it for communication between services inside the cluster (like talking between rooms), the GAMMA Initiative was created.</p>\n<p>GAMMA's main goal is to make it easier to set up and manage how services talk to each other in a cluster. They want to do this without changing the Gateway API too much and keeping its main way of working.</p>\n<p>They also want all projects using the Gateway API for service communication to do it in a similar way, no matter what technology they use. It's interesting that around the same time, another project called <a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/start/sandboxes/envoy-gateway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Envoy Gateway</a> started too.</p>\n<p>This shows that many are interested in making the Gateway API work better for both inside-cluster communication (east-west) and outside-cluster traffic (north-south).</p>\n<p>This means that in the future, the Gateway API could be used not just for letting traffic in from outside but also for helping services talk to each other within Kubernetes clusters.</p>\n<p>The work of the GAMMA initiative will be captured in Gateway Enhancement Proposals that extend or refine the Gateway API specification to cover mesh and mesh-adjacent use cases. To date, these have been relatively small changes (albeit sometimes with relatively large impacts!) and we expect that to continue. Governance of the Gateway API specification remains solely with the maintainers of the Gateway API subproject.</p>\n<p>The ideal final outcome of the GAMMA initiative is that service mesh use cases become a first-party concern of Gateway API, at which point there will be no further need for a separate initiative.</p>\n<h3 id=\"-summary\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-summary\" aria-label=\" summary permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg class=\"anchor-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a>📜 Summary</h3>\n<p>The Gateway API is like a newer version of the Kubernetes Ingress API. It provides a clearer set of rules for Kubernetes gateway providers compared to the older Ingress API.</p>\n<p>This upgrade enhances the features of the ingress gateway, making it easier to use and manage gateways by different groups. Additionally, the GAMMA initiative is working on combining the Ingress Gateway with the Gateway API for service mesh applications.</p>\n<p>There are plans to expand the Gateway API's capabilities to include east-west gateways through policy attachments.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong><em>Until next time, つづく 🎉</em></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 Thank you for Reading !! 🙌🏻😁📃, see you in the next blog.🤘  <em><strong>Until next time 🎉</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>🚀 Thank you for sticking up till the end.

However, EKS doesn't come with a built-in monitoring solution. This means that you need to set up your own monitoring stack if you want to track the health and performance of your EKS cluster.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will show you how to create a monitoring stack for AWS EKS using <strong>Grafana</strong>, <strong>Prometheus</strong>, <strong>AlertManager</strong>, <strong>Promtail</strong>, and <strong>Loki</strong>. These open source tools provide a comprehensive monitoring solution that can help you track all aspects of your EKS cluster, from metrics to logs.</p>\n<p>We will walk you through the steps of installing and configuring these tools, and we will show you how to create dashboards in Grafana to visualize your data. By the end of this article, you will have a solid understanding of how to monitor your AWS EKS cluster using open source tools.</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 680px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.58823529411765%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Grafana and Prometheus\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/aa73b94cec6b832e7e484005aa23ff4a/c5bb3/gr-prom.png\" srcset=\"/static/aa73b94cec6b832e7e484005aa23ff4a/04472/gr-prom.png 170w,\n/static/aa73b94cec6b832e7e484005aa23ff4a/9f933/gr-prom.png 340w,\n/static/aa73b94cec6b832e7e484005aa23ff4a/c5bb3/gr-prom.png 680w,\n/static/aa73b94cec6b832e7e484005aa23ff4a/5a190/gr-prom.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n    </span>\n          </p>\n<h3 id=\"-goals--objectives\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-goals--objectives\" aria-label=\" goals  objectives permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg class=\"anchor-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a>🎯 Goals &#x26; Objectives</h3>\n<p>If you are looking for a comprehensive and cost-effective monitoring solution for your AWS EKS cluster, then this monitoring stack is a great option.

It offers high uptime and supports data replication across multiple replicas for durability and fault tolerance. Loki is tightly integrated with Grafana, allowing you to visualize log metrics. Think of Loki as Prometheus, but for logs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 680px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 76.47058823529412%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Promtail\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/e34799ae75e169ae345722b568a24cc9/c5bb3/promtail.png\" srcset=\"/static/e34799ae75e169ae345722b568a24cc9/04472/promtail.png 170w,\n/static/e34799ae75e169ae345722b568a24cc9/9f933/promtail.png 340w,\n/static/e34799ae75e169ae345722b568a24cc9/c5bb3/promtail.png 680w,\n/static/e34799ae75e169ae345722b568a24cc9/f8067/promtail.png 726w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n    </span>\n          </p>\n<h3 id=\"-add-a-new-helm-repository\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-add-a-new-helm-repository\" aria-label=\" add a new helm repository permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg class=\"anchor-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a>📥 Add a New Helm Repository</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">helm repo <span class=\"token function\">add</span> grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts\nhelm repo update</code></pre></div>\n<h3 id=\"-run-the-helm-deployment-command\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-run-the-helm-deployment-command\" aria-label=\" run the helm deployment command permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg class=\"anchor-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a>🚀 Run the Helm Deployment Command</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">helm upgrade <span class=\"token parameter variable\">--install</span> loki grafana/loki-distributed <span class=\"token parameter variable\">-n</span> monitoring</code></pre></div>\n<p>After deploying Loki, update the Kube-Prometheus-stack values file to add additional data sources.
