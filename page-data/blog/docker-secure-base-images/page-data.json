It forms the core of your container and should be minimal, meaning it includes only the necessary components and dependencies. This minimization reduces the potential attack surface, making your applications more secure and efficient.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of minimal base images that are commonly used in containerization:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scratch</strong>:\n<a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/#create-a-simple-parent-image-using-scratch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scratch</a> is as minimal as it gets‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit's an empty base image. This means there are no pre-installed packages, libraries, or shells. While it might seem extreme, this approach is useful for certain scenarios, especially with Go applications that typically bundle all their dependencies. However, it can be challenging to add additional software to a Scratch-based image.</p>\n<p>When you use Scratch as a base image, you start with a completely clean slate, and you must add all the necessary files and dependencies for your application to run.</p>\n<p>Here are some key points to understand about Scratch:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zero Overhead</strong>: Scratch has virtually no overhead because it doesn't include any operating system components or unnecessary files. This makes it incredibly lightweight and efficient, which is ideal for certain use cases, especially in microservices architecture.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Control</strong>: Using Scratch gives you complete control over what goes into your container image. You can add only the essential files and libraries needed for your application, resulting in a minimal and highly optimized image.</li>\n<li><strong>Security Benefits</strong>: Since Scratch has no extraneous software or utilities, it inherently reduces the attack surface of your container. This minimalism can enhance security by minimizing the potential vulnerabilities present in your image.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenges</strong>: While Scratch offers many benefits, it also presents challenges. Since it's essentially an empty container, you need to handle all aspects of your application's runtime environment. This means you must manually add libraries, dependencies, and configuration files, which can be more complex and time-consuming than starting from a base image that includes these components.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's a simple example of creating a Dockerfile that uses Scratch as a base image for a minimal Go application:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"dockerfile\"><pre class=\"language-dockerfile\"><code class=\"language-dockerfile\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Use the official Golang base image to build your Go application</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> golang:1.17 <span class=\"token keyword\">AS</span> builder</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Set the working directory inside the container</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">WORKDIR</span> /app</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Copy the source code into the container</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> . .</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Build the Go application</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> go build -o myapp</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Create a new image using Scratch as the base</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> scratch</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Copy the compiled binary from the previous stage</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> <span class=\"token options\"><span class=\"token property\">--from</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">builder</span></span> /app/myapp /myapp</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Specify the command to run when the container starts</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">CMD</span> [<span class=\"token string\">\"/myapp\"</span>]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In this example, we first use the official Golang base image to build our Go application. Once the application is compiled, we create a new image using Scratch as the base. We then copy only the compiled binary into the Scratch-based image and specify the command to run the application.</p>\n<p>This Dockerfile creates an incredibly minimal container image that contains only your Go application, resulting in a minimal attack surface and efficient use of resources. However, remember that using Scratch requires careful consideration of all dependencies and runtime requirements for your application.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Distroless</strong>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Distroless</a> is a security-focused base image created by Google. It includes essential components like libc, passwd, groups, and a list of trusted certificate authorities but omits any shell. This minimalism enhances security by reducing potential entry points for attackers.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of creating a Dockerfile that uses Distroless as a base image for a minimal Go application:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"dockerfile\"><pre class=\"language-dockerfile\"><code class=\"language-dockerfile\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Use the official Golang base image to build your Go application</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> golang:1.17 <span class=\"token keyword\">AS</span> builder</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Set the working directory inside the container</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">WORKDIR</span> /app</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Copy the source code into the container</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> . .</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Build the Go application</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> go build -o myapp</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Create a new image using Distroless as the base</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Distroless images are available for various programming languages</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># In this case, we're using the golang Distroless image</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> gcr.io/distroless/base-debian11</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Copy the compiled binary from the previous stage</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> <span class=\"token options\"><span class=\"token property\">--from</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">builder</span></span> /app/myapp /myapp</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Specify the command to run when the container starts</span>\n<span class=\"token instruction\"><span class=\"token keyword\">CMD</span> [<span class=\"token string\">\"/myapp\"</span>]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In this example, we follow a similar pattern as before. We first use the official Golang base image to build our Go application. Once the application is compiled, we create a new image using Distroless as the base. We then copy only the compiled binary into the Distroless-based image and specify the command to run the application.</p>\n<p>Using Distroless as a base image strikes a balance between minimalism and convenience. It provides the necessary runtime components while eliminating unnecessary packages and tools that could pose security risks. Distroless images are available for various programming languages, making it a versatile choice for containerizing applications across different stacks.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"red-hat-ubi-universal-base-image\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#red-hat-ubi-universal-base-image\" aria-label=\"red hat ubi universal base image permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg class=\"anchor-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a>Red Hat UBI (Universal Base Image)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/redhat/ubi8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBIs)</a> are container base images provided by Red Hat.

This minimization reduces the potential attack surface, making your applications more secure and efficient.\n\nHere are some examples of minimal base images that are commonly used in containerization:\n\n1. **Scratch**:\n    [Scratch](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/#create-a-simple-parent-image-using-scratch) is as minimal as it gets‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit's an empty base image. This means there are no pre-installed packages, libraries, or shells. While it might seem extreme, this approach is useful for certain scenarios, especially with Go applications that typically bundle all their dependencies. However, it can be challenging to add additional software to a Scratch-based image.\n\n    When you use Scratch as a base image, you start with a completely clean slate, and you must add all the necessary files and dependencies for your application to run.\n\n    Here are some key points to understand about Scratch:\n\n    - **Zero Overhead**: Scratch has virtually no overhead because it doesn't include any operating system components or unnecessary files. This makes it incredibly lightweight and efficient, which is ideal for certain use cases, especially in microservices architecture.\n    - **Total Control**: Using Scratch gives you complete control over what goes into your container image. You can add only the essential files and libraries needed for your application, resulting in a minimal and highly optimized image.\n    - **Security Benefits**: Since Scratch has no extraneous software or utilities, it inherently reduces the attack surface of your container. This minimalism can enhance security by minimizing the potential vulnerabilities present in your image.\n    - **Challenges**: While Scratch offers many benefits, it also presents challenges. Since it's essentially an empty container, you need to handle all aspects of your application's runtime environment. This means you must manually add libraries, dependencies, and configuration files, which can be more complex and time-consuming than starting from a base image that includes these components.\n\n    Here's a simple example of creating a Dockerfile that uses Scratch as a base image for a minimal Go application:\n\n    ```dockerfile\n    # Use the official Golang base image to build your Go application\n    FROM golang:1.17 AS builder\n\n    # Set the working directory inside the container\n    WORKDIR /app\n\n    # Copy the source code into the container\n    COPY . .\n\n    # Build the Go application\n    RUN go build -o myapp\n\n    # Create a new image using Scratch as the base\n    FROM scratch\n\n    # Copy the compiled binary from the previous stage\n    COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp\n\n    # Specify the command to run when the container starts\n    CMD [\"/myapp\"]\n    ```\n\n    In this example, we first use the official Golang base image to build our Go application. Once the application is compiled, we create a new image using Scratch as the base. We then copy only the compiled binary into the Scratch-based image and specify the command to run the application.\n\n    This Dockerfile creates an incredibly minimal container image that contains only your Go application, resulting in a minimal attack surface and efficient use of resources. However, remember that using Scratch requires careful consideration of all dependencies and runtime requirements for your application.\n\n2. **Distroless**:\n   \n    [Distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) is a security-focused base image created by Google. It includes essential components like libc, passwd, groups, and a list of trusted certificate authorities but omits any shell. This minimalism enhances security by reducing potential entry points for attackers.\n\n    Here's an example of creating a Dockerfile that uses Distroless as a base image for a minimal Go application:\n\n    ```dockerfile\n    # Use the official Golang base image to build your Go application\n    FROM golang:1.17 AS builder\n\n    # Set the working directory inside the container\n    WORKDIR /app\n\n    # Copy the source code into the container\n    COPY . .\n\n    # Build the Go application\n    RUN go build -o myapp\n\n    # Create a new image using Distroless as the base\n    # Distroless images are available for various programming languages\n    # In this case, we're using the golang Distroless image\n    FROM gcr.io/distroless/base-debian11\n\n    # Copy the compiled binary from the previous stage\n    COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp\n\n    # Specify the command to run when the container starts\n    CMD [\"/myapp\"]\n    ```\n\n    In this example, we follow a similar pattern as before. We first use the official Golang base image to build our Go application. Once the application is compiled, we create a new image using Distroless as the base. We then copy only the compiled binary into the Distroless-based image and specify the command to run the application.\n\n    Using Distroless as a base image strikes a balance between minimalism and convenience. It provides the necessary runtime components while eliminating unnecessary packages and tools that could pose security risks. Distroless images are available for various programming languages, making it a versatile choice for containerizing applications across different stacks.\n\n###  Red Hat UBI (Universal Base Image)\n\n[Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBIs)](https://hub.docker.com/r/redhat/ubi8) are container base images provided by Red Hat. UBIs come in different variants, including minimal ones, which are suitable for secure containerization. Here's an example of creating a Dockerfile that uses Red Hat UBI as a base image for a minimal Go application:\n\n```dockerfile\n# Use the official Golang base image to build your Go application\nFROM golang:1.17 AS builder\n\n# Set the working directory inside the container\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy the source code into the container\nCOPY . .\n\n# Build the Go application\nRUN go build -o myapp\n\n# Create a new image using Red Hat UBI as the base\n# You can choose the minimal variant of Red Hat UBI for enhanced security\nFROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal\n\n# Copy the compiled binary from the previous stage\nCOPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp\n\n# Specify the command to run when the container starts\nCMD [\"/myapp\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, we begin by using the official Golang base image to build our Go application. Once the application is compiled, we create a new image using Red Hat UBI as the base. You can choose the \"ubi-minimal\" variant to reduce the attack surface and enhance security. We then copy only the compiled binary into the UBI-based image and specify the command to run the application.\n\nRed Hat UBI provides a secure and certified base image for containerization, which can be especially valuable in enterprise environments where security and compliance are critical considerations. The \"ubi-minimal\" variant is designed to minimize the image's footprint while ensuring it contains the necessary components for running applications.\n\n### üê∫ Introducing Wolfi: The Undistro for Container Environments\n\n[Chainguard](https://www.chainguard.dev/) has revealed [Wolfi](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/introducing-wolfi-the-first-linux-un-distro), a Linux distribution designed exclusively for container environments, built with a strong emphasis on securing the software supply chain. Wolfi is not your typical Linux distribution; it's what Chainguard refers to as an \"undistro\" because it's not intended for bare-metal use but is instead tailored for the cloud-native era.\n\n#### Key Features of Wolfi\n\nWolfi stands out with its unique features:\n\n- **Build-Time SBOM**: Wolfi provides a high-quality, build-time Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all included packages. This transparency ensures that you are aware of the components used in your container images, enhancing security and compliance.\n- **Granular and Independent Packages**: Each package included in Wolfi is designed to be granular and independent, allowing you to create minimal and efficient container images.\n- **apk Package Format**: Similar to Alpine Linux, Wolfi uses the proven and reliable apk package format. This choice ensures compatibility and ease of use for developers.\n- **Declarative and Reproducible Build System**: Wolfi offers a fully declarative and reproducible build system, promoting consistency and reliability in your containerized applications.\n- **Support for glibc and musl**: Wolfi is designed to support both glibc and musl, catering to a wide range of application requirements.\n\n#### Why Wolfi Is Different\n\nOne of the most significant differences between Wolfi and traditional Linux distributions is its lack of a Linux kernel. Instead, Wolfi relies on the underlying environment, such as the container runtime, to provide the kernel. This decision aligns with Wolfi's focus on minimalism and its role as an undistro for cloud-native environments.\n\nHere's an example of creating a Dockerfile that uses Wolfi as a base image for a minimal Go application:\n\n```dockerfile\n# Use the official Golang base image to build your Go application\nFROM golang:1.17 AS builder\n\n# Set the working directory inside the container\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy the source code into the container\nCOPY . .\n\n# Build the Go application\nRUN go build -o myapp\n\n# Create a new image using Wolfi as the base\nFROM wolfi:latest\n\n# Copy the compiled binary from the previous stage\nCOPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp\n\n# Specify the command to run when the container starts\nCMD [\"/myapp\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, we start by using the official Golang base image to build our Go application. After compiling the application, we create a new image using Wolfi as the base. Please note that you would typically specify the actual Wolfi image name and tag (e.g., \"wolfi:latest\") based on the Wolfi distribution you have.\n\nLike other minimal base images, Wolfi allows you to create secure and efficient container images. You can customize the image to include only the necessary components for your application, resulting in a smaller attack surface and optimized resource usage. Wolfi's emphasis on providing a build-time Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) ensures transparency and traceability in your containerized applications.\n\nFor more information and to get started with Wolfi, [visit Chainguard's official website](https://www.chainguard.io/wolfi).\n\n### üìå Closing Thoughts\n\nA good base image is the cornerstone of secure and efficient containerization.
