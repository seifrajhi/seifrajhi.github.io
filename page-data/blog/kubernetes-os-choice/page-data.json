This provides stronger security than the default Base64 encoding.\nKey points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No changes are required in how secrets are used.</li>\n<li>Encryption provider support must be enabled during EKS cluster creation</li>\n<li>Each secret write generates a unique Data Encryption Key (DEK).</li>\n<li>The DEK is encrypted with the CMK and stored in etcd.</li>\n<li>Decryption occurs when

Usually, the person who creates the EKS cluster has full control. But this can be a problem for security and management. AWS EKS has new controls called access entries to help manage who can access your Kubernetes clusters more easily.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we will show you how to use Terraform and OpenTofu to set up access entries for your AWS EKS clusters. We will explain what access entries are, the different options you can use, and how this new method makes it easier to manage who can access your clusters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-need-for-eks-access-entries\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-need-for-eks-access-entries\" aria-label=\"the need for eks access entries permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg class=\"anchor-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a>The Need for EKS access entries</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, we used a special <code class=\"language-text\">aws-auth</code> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/auth-configmap.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ConfigMap</a> to define the IAM roles for worker nodes, users, roles, and groups. This method required manual updates and was prone to errors, making it difficult to manage access at scale.</p>\n<p>With the introduction of Access Entries, AWS has provided a more streamlined and efficient way to manage access to EKS clusters. Now, we can manage access directly through the <a href=\"https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/eks/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EKS API</a> using AWS IAM as an authenticator. This means that when a user logs in to AWS, AWS handles the authentication, verifying the user's identity. When the user connects to Kubernetes, Kubernetes handles the authorization, checking the user's permissions within the cluster.</p>\n<p>This new approach integrates seamlessly with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kubernetes' RBAC</a> (Role-Based Access Control), providing a more robust and flexible access management system. One significant improvement is the ability to remove the \"default root user\" – the hidden cluster administrator created by default. Previously, this user could not be seen or changed, which sometimes caused issues.</p>\n<p>By moving access control to a dedicated infrastructure as code, we can manage access more easily and with less risk. In the old system, there was a chance you would lose cluster access if you deleted the cluster owner. Now, other users can add IAM principals to access the cluster through APIs, making it easier to manage access with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iac/#:~:text=Infrastructure%20as%20code%20(IaC)%20is%20used%20for%20infrastructure%20automation%20to,to%20set%20up%20infrastructure%20environments.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools</a> like <a href=\"https://opentofu.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenTofu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terraform</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pulumi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pulumi</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/getting_started/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ansible</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CloudFormation</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"note\">\n    <p><strong>🔵 Note:</strong></p>\n    <p>Access Entries also provide predefined access policies that can be assigned to IAM principals outside the cluster through EKS APIs.

By using both AWS IAM policies and Kubernetes RBAC, you can achieve a resilient and flexible access control system. This approach allows you to centrally manage permissions through AWS while also providing fine-grained control within the Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n<p><strong>Until next time 🎉</strong></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 Thank you for Reading !! 🙌🏻😁📃, see you in the next blog.🤘  <em><strong>Until next time 🎉</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>🚀 Thank you for sticking up till the end.
