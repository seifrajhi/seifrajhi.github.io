We present you with a collection of tips that will boost your productivity and enable you to accomplish your work more swiftly.</p>\n<div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:54%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/1C8bHHJturSx2\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use aliases and tab completion feature:</strong>\nAliases are a great way to shorten kubectl commands. For example, you could create an alias for the <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl get pods</code> command as <code class=\"language-text\">k get pods</code>. This can save you a lot of time if you use kubectl frequently.\nBy enabling tab completion, you can quickly navigate through commands, resources, and flags without having to remember or type them entirely.\nTo set up tab completion, refer to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/#optional-kubectl-configurations-and-plugins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kubernetes documentation</a> or your shell's specific instructions, and enjoy the ease of command exploration and input. üìö</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl explain</code> to get more information about a Kubernetes resource:</strong>\nThe <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl explain</code> command is a gem in the Kubernetes CLI toolbox. It can be used to get more information about a Kubernetes resource. This can be helpful if you are not sure what a particular resource does or how to configure it. For example, if you want to know more about the Deployment resource, you could run the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">kubectl explain Deployment</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will print out a detailed description of the Deployment resource, including its configuration options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl diff</code> to compare two Kubernetes manifests:</strong>\nThe <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl diff</code> command comes in handy when you want to compare the live state of your Kubernetes resources with their desired state declared in a YAML file.\nThis can be helpful if you are making changes to a Kubernetes manifest and want to see what the changes will do before you apply them. For example, if you have a Kubernetes manifest called <code class=\"language-text\">my-manifest.yaml</code> and you want to see what changes would be made if you added a new pod to the manifest, you could run the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">kubectl <span class=\"token function\">diff</span> my-manifest.yaml</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will print out a diff between the two manifests, showing you the differences between them.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:55%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/yqtpq8rqqXBh6\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl logs</code> to view the logs for a pod:</strong>\nThe <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl logs</code> command can be used to view the logs for a pod. This can be helpful if you are troubleshooting a problem with your application. For example, if you have a pod called <code class=\"language-text\">my-pod</code> and you want to see the logs for that pod, you could run the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">kubectl logs my-pod</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will print out the logs for the <code class=\"language-text\">my-pod</code> pod.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl top</code> to view the resource usage for a pod or container:</strong>\nThe <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl top</code> command can be used to view the resource usage for a pod or container. This can be helpful if you are trying to optimize the performance of your application. For example, if you want to see the resource usage for the <code class=\"language-text\">my-pod</code> pod, you could run the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">kubectl <span class=\"token function\">top</span> my-pod</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will print out the resource usage for the <code class=\"language-text\">my-pod</code> pod.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl rollout</code> to deploy changes to your applications safely:</strong>\nThe <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl rollout</code> command allows you to manage and monitor rolling updates to your deployments. By using commands like <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl rollout status &lt;deployment-name></code> or <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl rollout history &lt;deployment-name></code>, you can track the progress and history of your deployments, easily roll back to previous versions if necessary, and ensure smooth updates without downtime.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><code class=\"language-text\">kubectl events</code> command to view events that have occurred in your Kubernetes cluster:</strong>\nWhen you run <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl events</code>, it retrieves the latest events for various Kubernetes resources, such as pods, deployments, services, nodes, and more. These events provide information about the lifecycle of the resources, including their creation, deletion, updates, and other relevant status changes.\nThe output of the <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl events</code> command typically includes the following details for each event:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>NAMESPACE:</strong> The namespace in which the event occurred.</li>\n<li><strong>LAST SEEN:</strong> The timestamp indicating when the event was last observed.</li>\n<li><strong>KIND:</strong> The type of resource (e.g., Pod, Deployment, Service, Node, etc.).</li>\n<li><strong>TYPE:</strong> The type of event (e.g., Normal or Warning).</li>\n<li><strong>REASON:</strong> The reason for the event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl events</code> command helps you monitor the progress and status of various resources in real-time. It can be particularly useful for troubleshooting issues, understanding resource behavior, tracking changes, and identifying any potential problems or errors.\nYou can also filter the events based on specific resources or namespaces by using the appropriate flags with the <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl events</code> command. For example, you can run <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl events --namespace &lt;namespace></code> to view events only within a specific namespace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Kubernetes Resource Creation with <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl create</code>: The benefit of the <code class=\"language-text\">--dry-run</code> Flag:</strong>\nThe <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl create</code> command is used to create new Kubernetes resources. However, sometimes you may want to test a resource creation without actually executing it. This is where the <code class=\"language-text\">--dry-run</code> flag comes in.\nThe <code class=\"language-text\">--dry-run=client -oyaml</code> flag tells kubectl to simulate the creation of a resource without actually creating it. This means that kubectl will print out the YAML configuration of the resource that would be created, but it will not actually create the resource.\nThis is a valuable technique for testing and verifying your resource configurations before applying them. For example, you can use the <code class=\"language-text\">--dry-run=client -oyaml</code> flag to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Validate your YAML configuration files.</li>\n<li>Verify that the resource creation will succeed or encounter any issues.</li>\n<li>Test the resource creation with different values.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To use the <code class=\"language-text\">--dry-run=client</code> flag, simply pass it as an argument to the <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl create</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl run</code> command.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/IdrPndu51edqSiTJPg\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h2 id=\"-key-takeaways\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-key-takeaways\" aria-label=\" key takeaways permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg class=\"anchor-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a>üìå Key takeaways</h2>\n<p>In this blog post, we have covered some of the most useful tips and tricks for using the Kubernetes CLI.
