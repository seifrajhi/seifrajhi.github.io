Simplicity is key to achieving maintainability, scalability, ease of use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>YAGNI Principle</strong>: \"You Aren't Gonna Need It\" advises against implementing functionality until it is actually needed.

Focus on optimization when it is truly necessary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Boy Scout Rule</strong>: Encourage developers to continually improve the codebase by refactoring and eliminating technical debt. Leave the codebase cleaner than you found it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fail Fast Philosophy</strong>: Promote quick testing and iteration. Learn from mistakes and failures along the way to achieve better outcomes faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Bus Factor</strong>: Ensure that no single person or small group holds critical knowledge or skills that would be catastrophic if lost. Encourage cross-training and documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Conway's Law</strong>: The structure of an organization will influence the design of the software it produces.
