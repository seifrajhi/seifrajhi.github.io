Simplicity is key to achieving maintainability, scalability, ease of use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>YAGNI Principle</strong>: \"You Aren't Gonna Need It\" advises against implementing functionality until it is actually needed.

Focus on optimization when it is truly necessary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Boy Scout Rule</strong>: Encourage developers to continually improve the codebase by refactoring and eliminating technical debt. Leave the codebase cleaner than you found it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fail Fast Philosophy</strong>: Promote quick testing and iteration. Learn from mistakes and failures along the way to achieve better outcomes faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Bus Factor</strong>: Ensure that no single person or small group holds critical knowledge or skills that would be catastrophic if lost.

The idea is simple: no team should be so large that it can't be fed with two pizzas. This typically means teams of fewer than 10 people. This strategy has been instrumental in driving Amazon's innovation and efficiency.</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 680px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.470588235294116%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/003b9f83a3fe61544692942c7e5d0ae7/c5bb3/two-pizza-teams.png\" srcset=\"/static/003b9f83a3fe61544692942c7e5d0ae7/04472/two-pizza-teams.png 170w,\n/static/003b9f83a3fe61544692942c7e5d0ae7/9f933/two-pizza-teams.png 340w,\n/static/003b9f83a3fe61544692942c7e5d0ae7/c5bb3/two-pizza-teams.png 680w,\n/static/003b9f83a3fe61544692942c7e5d0ae7/b12f7/two-pizza-teams.png 1020w,\n/static/003b9f83a3fe61544692942c7e5d0ae7/b5a09/two-pizza-teams.png 1360w,\n/static/003b9f83a3fe61544692942c7e5d0ae7/df5d6/two-pizza-teams.png 2514w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n    </span>\n          </p>\n<h2 id=\"-the-benefits-of-two-pizza-teams\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-the-benefits-of-two-pizza-teams\" aria-label=\" the benefits of two pizza teams permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg class=\"anchor-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a>🚀 The Benefits of Two-Pizza Teams</h2>\n<h3 id=\"minimized-communication-lines\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#minimized-communication-lines\" aria-label=\"minimized communication lines permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg class=\"anchor-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a>Minimized Communication Lines</h3>\n<p>Smaller teams reduce the complexity of communication, making it easier to coordinate and make decisions quickly.

Smaller teams allow for more recognition of individual contributions and clearer ownership of tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Gallup's \"State of the American Workplace\"</strong>: This study showed that smaller organizations have higher employee engagement levels.

This tweet sparked a heated debate about what it means to be “technically excellent.”</p>\n<p>In this blog post, we will explore why technical skills are important for engineering managers, especially when there are senior tech leads within the team. We will also discuss the cognitive dissonance created by Musk’s tweet and how it relates to modern management practices.</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 680px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.294117647058826%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/1b424a92301101c399a624fa92553449/c5bb3/emusk-tweet.png\" srcset=\"/static/1b424a92301101c399a624fa92553449/04472/emusk-tweet.png 170w,\n/static/1b424a92301101c399a624fa92553449/9f933/emusk-tweet.png 340w,\n/static/1b424a92301101c399a624fa92553449/c5bb3/emusk-tweet.png 680w,\n/static/1b424a92301101c399a624fa92553449/b12f7/emusk-tweet.png 1020w,\n/static/1b424a92301101c399a624fa92553449/b5a09/emusk-tweet.png 1360w,\n/static/1b424a92301101c399a624fa92553449/0d390/emusk-tweet.png 1472w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n    </span>\n          </p>\n<h2 id=\"️-why-technical-skills-matter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#%EF%B8%8F-why-technical-skills-matter\" aria-label=\"️ why technical skills matter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg class=\"anchor-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a>🛠️ Why Technical Skills Matter</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Effective Communication</strong>: Technical managers can talk easily with both tech and non-tech teams.
